    <h4>An Enemy of the People, by Henrik Ibsen</h4>
    <p>
        Morten Kiil. Do you know what money I have bought these shares with?
        No, of course you can't know—but I will tell you. It is the money that
        Katherine and Petra and the boys will have when I am gone. Because I
        have been able to save a little bit after all, you know.
        <br><br>
        Dr. Stockmann (flaring up). And you have gone and taken Katherine's
        money for this!
        <br><br>
        Morten Kiil. Yes, the whole of the money is invested in the Baths now.
        And now I just want to see whether you are quite stark, staring mad,
        Thomas! If you still make out that these animals and other nasty things
        of that sort come from my tannery, it will be exactly as if you were to
        flay broad strips of skin from Katherine's body, and Petra's, and the
        boys'; and no decent man would do that—unless he were mad.
        <br><br>
        Dr. Stockmann (walking up and down). Yes, but I am mad; I am mad!
        <br><br>
        Morten Kiil. You cannot be so absurdly mad as all that, when it is a
        question of your wife and children.
        <br><br>
        Dr. Stockmann (standing still in front of him). Why couldn't you
        consult me about it, before you went and bought all that trash?
        <br><br>
        Morten Kiil. What is done cannot be undone.
